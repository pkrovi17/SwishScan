1. Frontend
swift & swiftui for ios
2. Backend
Python (flask prolly)
3. Video Processing & Analysis
OpenCV – for frame extraction, preprocessing, and visual annotations
MediaPipe – fast and easy hand/pose tracking from Google
Deep Learning (PyTorch / TensorFlow) – custom models for:
Shot classification (e.g., success, form)
Motion similarity (e.g., Siamese network for player matching)
YOLOv8 / Detectron2 – for more advanced detection (ball, player)
4. NBA Player Data & Modeling
Curate a dataset of NBA shots from YouTube, Synergy, etc.
Use pose data to create vector embeddings for each player’s shot style
Use t-SNE / PCA / UMAP + clustering (KNN, Cosine Sim) to find similar shooting styles
5. Database
MongoDB
